## abcd-graph 0.5.0-beta (unreleased)
- Complete rewrite and file restructure to simplify and increase speed.

### Breaking Changes
- Main class ABCD stores parameters, and has a .sample() method
- ABCD.sample() returns an ABCDSample object that stores the graph and community data
- ABCD parameter name changes (gamma -> degree_exponent, beta -> community_size_exponent)
- Raise warning instead of error when powerlaw exponents are outside the expected ranges
- Removed callbacks
- Removed visualizer
- removed mypy from ci (not compatible with numba)
- removed [igraph], [networkx], [scipy], [matplotlib] optional dependencies
- moved dev and docs dependencies to uv's dependency-groups
- minimum python version bumped to 3.12
- minimum numpy version bumped to 2.1

### Features
- Added overlap capabilities via parameters eta and rho
- ABCD has a .fit(ABCDSample) method to fit the ABCD parameters to the empirical parameters observed in the sample ([fork/#5](https://github.com/ryandewolfe33/abcd-graph/pull/5))

### Enhancements
- Much faster sampling
- More comprehensive testing
- readthedocs style documentation ([fork/#7](https://github.com/ryandewolfe33/abcd-graph/pull/7))
- Run benchmarks in CI ([fork/#8](https://github.com/ryandewolfe33/abcd-graph/pull/8))
- Migrate all workflows to uv ([fork/#8](https://github.com/ryandewolfe33/abcd-graph/pull/8))
- Run pre-commit workflow with prek
- Replaced flake8 with ruff for linting
- Default max_degree and max_community_size grows with n
