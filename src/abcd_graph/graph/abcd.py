class ABCD:
    """Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection

    This class combines the ABCDGraph and ABCDParams class, essentially adding a
    sample method to ABCDParams.

    Parameters
    ----------

    vcount : int
        The number of vertices in the graph.

    gamma : float, default=2.5
        Powerlaw exponent for the degree distribution. Not used if
        degree_sequence is passed.

    beta: float, default=1.5
        Powerlaw exponent for the community size distribution. Not used if a
        custom community_size_sequence is passed.

    xi: float, default=0.25
        Proportion of edges in the global background graph. Setting xi=0 gives
        disjoint communities while xi=1 gives a random graph with no community
        structure.

    min_degree : int,  default=5
        Minimum degree in the graph. Not used if degree_sequence is passed.

    max_degree : int, default=30
        Maximum degree in the graph. Not used if degree_sequence is passed.

    min_community_size : int, default=20
        Minimum community size. Not used if a custom community_size_sequence
        is passed.

    max_community_size: int, default=250
        Maximum community size. Not used if a custom community_size_sequence
        is passed.

    degree_sequence : Sequence[int] | NDArray[np.int64] | None, default=None
        Used to pass a custom degree sequence that overrides the default
        powerlaw distribution.

    community_size_sequence : Sequence[int] | NDArray[np.int64] | None, default=None
        Used to pass a custom community size sequence that overrides the default
        powerlaw distribution. The sum of the community sizes must equal the number
        of vertices minus the number of outliers.

    num_outliers : int, default=0
        The number of outliers. These vertices have their entire degree in the
        global background graph so do not appear in any community.

    model : Model | None, default=None
        Random graph model used to sample the community and background graphs.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Flag to log runtime infomation.
